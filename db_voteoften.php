	For Example:
	If the web server file system is in /var/www, www is the root of the domain.
	From accessing the web site via wget or with a browser, you can only look at
	files in /var/www and below.
	Therefore, put this file in /var.

	Make the permissions readable by the username that owns the web server process.
	To load this file use require_once.
